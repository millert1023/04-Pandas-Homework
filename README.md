I am the Chief Data Scientist for the cityâ€™s school district.  The mayor and the school board has asked me to assist with the strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
My first task was to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I was tasked to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The file to use is PyCitySchools.ipynb

My findings were as follows:
Overall data across all districts show that average reading score is higher and as a result the percentage of students pass is higher.
 
When you group by schools and sort by Overall passing rate, the top 5 performers are charter schools while the bottom 5 performers are District schools
 

 
This was apparent when you look at the data by school type.  Charter Schools had higher average math and reading scores, percentage of students passing both Math and Reading.
 
Interestingly, when you slice the data by school spending per student, those schools that spend less than $580 per student have higher passing rates in both Math and Reading.
 
When you look at the data based on the size of the school, smaller schools (school size less than 1000) had highest Math and Reading scores and Overall Passing Rate but mediums size schools had the highest percent of students that had passing Math and Reading scores.
